# **AI Fracture Detection with Enhanced Image Processing and Deep Learning**

This repository contains code for detecting and classifying spinal fractures using deep learning models, including EfficientNet, ResNet, and DenseNet. The project also explores the impact of **image preprocessing techniques**, such as **Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)**, to improve model performance.

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to accurately classify **X-ray images** as either **fractured** or **non-fractured** by leveraging **deep learning models** and **enhanced image preprocessing techniques**. The key steps include:

1. **Dataset Preparation:**  
   - Loading a dataset of spinal X-ray images.  
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.  

2. **Baseline Model Training:**  
   - Fine-tuning **pretrained deep learning models** (EfficientNet, ResNet, DenseNet) on raw images.  
   - Establishing baseline performance metrics.  

3. **Image Transformations:**  
   - Applying **image enhancement techniques** such as **Histogram Equalization, CLAHE, and Unsharp Masking** to augment the dataset.  

4. **Model Retraining:**  
   - Training models on the **transformed dataset** to evaluate the impact of preprocessing techniques.  

5. **Evaluation and Results:**  
   - Comparing **Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, and Recall** across different models and transformations.  
   - Visualizing performance differences through graphs and tables.

## **Key Features**

‚úÖ **Advanced Image Preprocessing**  
- CLAHE enhances image contrast for improved feature extraction.  
- Additional transformations improve model robustness.  

‚úÖ **Deep Learning Models**  
- **EfficientNet, ResNet, and DenseNet** are fine-tuned for fracture detection.  

‚úÖ **Hugging Face Model Hosting**  
- The trained models are **saved and uploaded to Hugging Face Hub** for easy access.  

‚úÖ **User-Friendly Inference**  
- A **Gradio-based web app** allows users to **upload an X-ray image** and receive a fracture diagnosis in real time.

## **How It Works**

1. **Upload an X-ray Image**  
   - Users can upload an X-ray image through a simple web interface.  

2. **Image Preprocessing with CLAHE**  
   - CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) is applied to enhance the image contrast.  

3. **Fracture Classification**  
   - The **EfficientNet model** classifies the image as **Fractured** or **Not Fractured**.  

4. **Prediction Output**  
   - The model‚Äôs prediction is displayed on the interface.
